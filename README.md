# üõçÔ∏è Product API (Quarkus + Hibernate Reactive)

This API allows you to manage products including creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and checking product availability. It is built using Quarkus, Hibernate Reactive, and Mutiny for asynchronous and reactive operations.

## ü™µ Logging

- Log messages are stored in: `D:/logs/`
- The application creates the directory if it does not exist.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Quarkus**
- **Hibernate Reactive + Panache**
- **Mutiny Uni**
- **RESTEasy Reactive**
- **Lombok** (optional)
- **SLF4J / JBoss Logging**

# quarkus-test-api

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:8080/q/dev/>.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/quarkus-test-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.

## üß™ Improvements

- I will add unit or integration tests using `@QuarkusTest` later on as right now getting some errors
- There is always room for improvement
